# Avax Racing League

Our objective is to introduce a unique value proposition to the Live for Speed video game by incorporating decentralization and a rewards system for players. We aim to recognize and reward drivers based on their achievements, such as attaining high scores, recording faster race times, or demonstrating exceptional skills. To realize this vision, we intend to leverage the Avalanche platform, which offers a suite of advanced solutions perfectly suited to our enhancement strategy.



# Avalanche Solution

In Live For Speed, we have integrated various solutions from Avalanche to enhance our platform. We use Avalanche CLI to manage the creation of subnets and have developed two tokens: AvaxRacingToken, which allows users to earn rewards, and AvaxRacingGovernance, which empowers pilots to vote on proposals such as changes to tracks, vehicles, judges, and other adjustments. To achieve this, we leverage the Avalanche Starter Kit, which simplifies the use of the Avalanche virtual machine from the outset. Additionally, we incorporated Teleport to enable interoperability between networks, allowing users to receive and transfer their tokens across any of them.
